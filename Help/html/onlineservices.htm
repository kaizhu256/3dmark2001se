  <p>3DMark2001 SE is more than just a mind-blowing demo, ultra-cool interactive 
    game and system stressing performance tests. If you are connected to the Internet, 
    you can access the Online ResultBrowser, which will show you detailed information 
    about the performance of your PC, as well as what kind of performance you 
    could expect if you were to upgrade your graphics card or CPU. Comparing your 
    score to results from other PCs from around the world is another feature of 
    our Online ResultBrowser. </p>

  <p>And this is only the beginning. Because the Online ResultBrowser is on-line, 
    we are constantly developing and improving the services we offer. Therefore 
    we recommend that you try our Online ResultBrowser immediately, but come back 
    every now and then to see what new features have been developed since your 
    last visit.</p>

<h3>Our results database</h3>

  <p>When you have finished running 3DMark2001 SE, we hope that you continue your 
    MadOnion.com experience by accessing our Online ResultBrowser and submit your 
    result to our database. Your results will not be publicly displayed and there 
    is no way anybody could locate your results or find out which one's belong 
    to you (that is, unless you choose to "publish" your results and share them 
    with your colleagues). The results we collect will be used for generating 
    statistics and recommendations for other users. This means that every result 
    you submit will help other users select reliable hardware upgrades, and their 
    submitted results will give you more reliable information about the performance 
    of other hardware other than what you currently have in your system. </p>
  <p>There is also a separate &quot;Submit Saved Results&quot; functionality in 
    3DMark2001 SE for submitting earlier run benchmarks, for example from another 
    PC.</p>

<a name="compare"></a><br><br>
<h3>Compare</h3>

  <p>It is nice to get a score for the performance of your PC, but it is even 
    more valuable if you can compare that score with other systems. MadOnion.com's 
    on-line services offer several different ways to compare scores. You can look 
    at several different statistics from the results in our database, or you can 
    take a look at results submitted and publicly posted by other users. Also, 
    if you want to squeeze every bit of 3D power of your PC, remember to visit 
    our discussion forum and ask for tuning advice from the highly talented people 
    in the MadOnion.com community.</p>

  <p>The Online ResultBrowser offers a number of comparisons based on the submitted 
    results in our database. Of particular interest should be the comparison, 
    where you see your own score and scores of other PCs very similar to yours, 
    but with other graphics cards. Since these other results are based on real 
    submitted results, it is most likely that your PC's performance would be the 
    same if you would change your graphics card. The same kind of comparison is 
    offered for CPUs - 3DMark scores of systems similar to yours, with different 
    CPUs, are compared to your score.</p>

<h3>Upgrade recommendations</h3>

<p>As described above, the on-line services give you reliable estimates of what your PC's performance would be if you upgraded your graphics card. The performance estimates are reliable, because they are based on benchmark results of PCs similar to yours, but with a different graphics card. Beside the result of the other graphics card, you can see the price of that graphics card. If you find a card giving you a desired performance boost and matching your budget, click on the link and order that card on-line. It really is that easy.</p>

<p>Since we are talking about on-line services, remember that they will be developed further long after this text was written and 3DMark2001 was published. There will most likely be new services introduced of which we have no idea yet, because we haven't even invented them yet. Therefore, we recommend that you every now and then access our on-line services and see if there are some new services, which would be particularly interesting and valuable to you.</p>

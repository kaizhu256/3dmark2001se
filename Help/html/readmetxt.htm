  <blockquote>
  <p>MadOnion.com is proud to present 3DMark2001, the global standard for 3D game 
    performance measurement. Like all of our benchmarks in the 3DMark Series, 
    3DMark2001 is an accurate and reliable diagnostics tool, which continues to 
    provide you with benchmark results that empower you to make informed hardware 
    assessments. It also combines DirectX®8 support with stunning scenes in real 
    time 3D graphics, giving you a hint of what the graphics quality in games 
    could be in the future.</p>
  While running the awesome scenes, 3DMark measures the game performance of your 
  PC and provides you with: 
  <ul>
    <li>The 3DMark score, which is a standard, globally recognized, comparable 
      measurement of PC game performance. 
    <li>Detailed results of all of the tests, including tests measuring theoretical 
      speed, and some trying out new DirectX®8 hardware accelerated features. 
          <li>Comparison of your system's 3D gaming performance to the results 
            of other 3DMark2001 users from around the world. See how your PC performs 
            against the fastest PCs there is. 
          <li>A reliable estimate of how your system would perform, if you were to upgrade 
      your graphics card or CPU.

          Second Edition (build 300) was our major update for 3DMark2001, and 
          as such, even contained a new test. The Advanced Pixel Shader test demonstrates 
          the latest in Pixel Shader technology, but also offers some nice eye 
          candy. Four months after the 3DMark2001 SE launch DX9 betas got out 
          and revealed a DX version identification problem. Also, new hardware 
          has been released or will be released in the near future, requiring 
          further updating. All of this made it sensible to update 3DMark2001, 
          to build 330, in order to offer the latest technology for 3D game performance 
          benchmarking.</font></p>

      to 3DMark®2001 SE</font></b> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p> 3DMark2001 SE is a diagnostics tool for measuring the 3D game performance 
          of PCs. It is entertaining and easy to use, which makes it "must have" 
          software for all home PC users interested in 3D games. Even a beginner 
          PC user can get a game performance measurement with 3DMark2001 SE. For 
          the more advanced users, 3DMark2001 SE offers a wide range of display 
          settings and testing options for the benchmark run. The most skillful 
          performance tweakers can get the latest news on PC performance upgrading 
          through MadOnion.com's on-line services. There you can also challenge 
          the fastest PCs in the world and get good performance tuning advice 
          in the discussion forum or the on-line chat.</p>
        <p>At the same time, 3DMark2001 SE is a reliable tool for professional 
          hardware performance measurement and comparison. The Pro version of 
          3DMark2001 SE includes additional tools for pro-users, making their 
          work easier, less time consuming and more fun. The Pro version of 3DMark2001 
          SE can be purchased on-line, allowing you access to all of the &quot;Pro 
          features&quot;.</p>
        <p>3DMark2001 SE uses a real game engine (MAX-FX Technology™, by Remedy 
          Entertainment) in all tests. This means that the obtained performance 
          level in the game tests is accurate. If additional time would be spent 
          on implementing more content, interactivity and game storylines, all 
          game tests could be made into real games. We have proven this by making 
          a game demo of the first game test. The scene is the same as in the 
          test, but this time you are behind the steering wheel.</p>

      <b><font size="3" color="EFB100">System Requirements</font></b> 
      <blockquote> 
        <p>3DMark2001 SE is the tool for measuring 3D game performance of the 
          latest PC hardware. This means that some older hardware does not have 
          what it takes to run some of 3DMark2001 SE. If your system cannot run 
          3DMark2001 SE, we encourage you to download (from www.MadOnion.com) 
          and run 3DMark2000.</p>
        Minimum System Requirements: 
        <ul>
          <li>Intel® compatible 500 MHz processor 
          <li>128 MB system memory 
          <li>A modern 3D accelerator with 32MB of memory 
          <li>Windows 98/SE, ME, 2000 or XP operating system 
          <li>DirectX<font size="2", face="Arial, sans-serif" color="E0DCD3">®</font> 
            8.1 or later 
        </ul>
        <p><b>NOTE:</b> If you run Windows 2000 or Windows XP, 192 MB of system memory is recommended.</p>
        <p>3DMark2001 SE may run on systems that don't quite meet the minimum 
          requirements, but for example less video memory will cause texture swapping 
          in the middle of some tests. The texture swapping would seriously distort 
          the test result, which means that the result could not be considered 
          a reliable measurement of the system's game performance.</p>
        Recommended System Specifications: 
        <ul>
          <li>Intel® compatible 1 GHz processor 
          <li>DirectX® 8 compatible graphics hardware 
        </ul>

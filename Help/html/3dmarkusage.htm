  <h3>Official Testing Guidelines</h3>
  <p>In order to get accurate and repeatable benchmark results, you should follow 
    the requirements and recommendations below. These guidelines may be updated 
    from time to time. Up-to-date guidelines are available on the <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="http://www.madonion.com/products/3dmark2001">3DMark2001 
    SE web site</a>.</p>
  <p>Official Testing Requirements are: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Restart the computer before running the benchmark. 
    <li>Compare 3D accelerators using the same CPU and the best (default) rendering 
      pipeline setting. 
    <li>Compare 3D accelerators using the the same settings - resolution, color 
      depth, texture resolution, z-buffer format, buffering mode and full-screen 
      anti-aliasing. 
    <li>Compare CPUs using the exact same system configuration (where possible). 
    <li>Exit all other programs. Under the 32-bit Windows operating systems, other 
      tasks can preemptively run during the tests, thus affecting the results. 
      You will want to eliminate as many of these types of tasks as possible, 
      such as automatic updates in operating systems, e-mail clients or other 
      tasks from your StartUp folder. This action also maximizes your available 
      memory. 
    <li>Disable all file sharing and possibly also all network connections. Background 
      network activity may affect results. 
    <li>Follow a standard testing procedure each time you run the tests. Run the 
      tests at least three times to verify that the results are reproducible.
  </ul>
  <p><b>NOTE: </b>All benchmark tests are run with VSync disabled to eliminate the 
    refresh rate dependencies along different test environments. However, older 
    display card drivers might not support this feature. This means that it is 
    up to you to observe whether VSync is disabled or not. </p>
  <p>Additional Recommendations for Testing: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We recommend using the default display settings, since this is the standard 
      measurement in 3DMark2001 SE. 
    <li>We recommend testing CPUs by running game tests with the fastest available 
      3D accelerator, in the lowest possible resolution. 
    <li>We recommend that you use the same monitor and monitor settings for all 
      tested 3D accelerators. 
    <li>We recommend that you test on a "clean" system only. You should use a 
      program like "Norton Ghost" (http://www.ghost.com) to restore a clean system 
      for every test case.
    <li>We recommend that you disable the System Restore feature on Windows ME. 
      For more information, please see Microsoft Knowledge Base article Q267951. 
  </ul>

  <p>These measures help to ensure that your results are consistent.</p>
  <p><b>NOTE: </b>3DMARK2001 SE BENCHMARK RESULTS ARE COMPARABLE WITH 3DMARK2001 
    RESULTS, BUT INCOMPATIBLE WITH ANY PREVIOUS VERSIONS OF 3DMARK.</p>

  <h3>The Main Window</h3>
  <p> <img src="../images/s-main-window.jpg" width="390" height="363"> 
  <p> 
  <p>The buttons in the lower right corner are the most important buttons in 3DMark2001 
    SE. They start the Benchmark run, the Demo and the Game Demo. The Benchmark 
    button always starts the benchmark using the selected display settings and 
    selected tests. After startup the default settings are active, which means 
    that all of the tests are selected and the <a class="normal" href="#defaultsettings">default 
    display settings</a> are used.</p>
  <p>The Demo button opens a dialog, which asks if the demo should be run using 
    the selected display settings or if a lower resolution should be used. If 
    your system meets the <a class="normal" href="index.htm#system">minimum system 
    requirements</a> of 3DMark2001 SE, we recommend the lower resolution for a 
    higher frame rate and a better experience. If your system meets the <a class="normal" href="index.htm#system">recommended 
    system</a> suggestions, we recommend running the demo using the default display 
    settings or turning on Full-Scene Anti-Aliasing (FSAA), if available. When 
    you run the demo using selected settings, all of the settings in the <a class="normal" href="3dmarkusage.htm#dsettings">Display 
    Settings dialog</a> will be used.</p>
  <p>The Game Demo button starts the interactive game demo. It is the first game 
    test, with the car being chased by flying hunter robots, but this time you 
    control the car. Drive around and shoot down all flying robots using the <a class="normal" href="quickstart.htm#play">control 
    keys</a>. The game demo is only available in the registered Pro version of 
    3DMark2001 SE.</p>
  <a name="description"></a><br>
  <br>
  <h3>Project Description</h3>
  <p>A file with saved results of a benchmark run is called a project. A project 
    also contains your system info and the display settings used during the benchmark 
    run. It is a good idea to save the project with a descriptive file name. You 
    can also give the project a name and some more extensive comments in order 
    to make it easier for you to remember the conditions of that particular benchmark 
    run. The project name and comments can be edited by clicking the Edit button 
    in the Project frame of the main window.</p>
  <a name="selecttests"></a><br>
  <br>
  <h3>Select Tests</h3>
  <p>By default all of the tests are selected, but you can also choose to run 
    only certain tests. For example the 3DMark score requires only that all the 
    game tests are selected. Select the tests to be run by clicking the Change 
    button in the Select Tests frame.</p>
  <p> <img src="../images/s-select-tests-window.jpg" width="277" height="370"> 
  <p> 
  <p>The Select Tests dialog has two tabs. The Normal view shows the tests in 
    their logical groups. Uncheck a checkbox to run the next benchmark without 
    that group of tests. The Custom view shows all the test groups and all the 
    separate tests included in those groups. So you can for example choose to 
    run the <a class="normal" href="tests.htm#bumpmapping">Environment Bump Mapping</a> 
    test, but skip the <a class="normal" href="tests.htm#dot3">DOT3</a> Bump Mapping 
    test.</p>
  <a name="options"></a><br>
  <br>
  <h3>Options</h3>
  <p>Click the Change button of the Options frame to modify benchmark, demo and 
    game demo options. You can set the following options from the Options dialog:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Benchmark - Disable title screens between tests.</b> Check the checkbox, 
      if you don't want to see the title screens between the tests, which are 
      displayed while the next test loads. This might make the whole benchmark 
      run take less time, because it takes less time to load some tests than the 
      time the title screen is displayed. The title screen is displayed a minimum 
      of 4 seconds in order to give the user time to read the text. On some systems 
      the title screen is visible less than 4 seconds due to a slow syncronization 
      of the monitor between a test and the next title screen.</li>
    <li><b>Benchmark - Looping.</b> Here you can set the benchmark to loop infinitely. 
      This feature is useful if you want to use 3DMark2001 SE as demonstration 
      software at a tradeshow or in a PC hardware store. 
    <li><b>Benchmark - Repeat.</b> You can select how many times you want to repeat 
      each test in the benchmark run or in the batch run. The given result will 
      be an average of all those runs. 
    <li> <b>Demo - Disable sounds.</b> If you want to run or loop the demo without 
      sounds, you can turn down the sound of your system, or you can check this 
      checkbox. 
    <li><b>Demo - Looping.</b> The demo will loop infinitely if you check this 
      checkbox. This feature is useful if you want to use 3DMark2001 SE as demonstration 
      software at a tradeshow or in a PC hardware store. 
    <li><b>Game - Disable Sound Effects. </b> If you want to play the interactive 
      game demo without the soundeffects of the engine, tires, enemy fire and 
      explosions, just check this checkbox. 
    <li><b>Game - Disable Music.</b> There is background music in the game demo. 
      If you want to play the game demo without the music, just check this checkbox. 
    <li> <b>Game - Detail Level.</b> You can select if you want to run the game 
      demo in low or high graphical detail level. These detail levels match the 
      ones of <a class="normal" href="tests.htm#gametests"> game test 1</a> of 
      the benchmark run, except for the dynamic shadows. In the low detail test 
      of the benchmark, there are no dynamic shadows, but in the game demo all 
      movable objects have dynamic shadows. This is because the low detail game 
      test should work well also on older systems that cannot do the shadows in 
      hardware, but would take too bad a performance hit of doing the shadows 
      in software. Still, it's not the same without the shadows, so we have those 
      in the game demo also in low detail. Also, the huge walker is not present 
      in the game demo, since it would have required a substantial amount of work 
      to add all interactions with a live player. 
  </ul>
 
 <a name="dsettings"></a><br>
  <br>
  <h3>Display Settings</h3>
  <p>Click the Change... button in the Display and CPU settings frame to open 
    the Display Settings dialog. All tests in the benchmark run will use these 
    settings. The demo and game demo also use these settings if you choose to 
    run them with the selected settings. Alternatively you can choose to run them 
    in 640x480 resolution to get a better frame rate.</p>
  <b>Rendering Platform</b><br>
  If you have more than one active 3D accelerated graphics card installed, this 
  is where you can select which one to use in the benchmark run. You may see two 
  identical selections if you have a card that can support a dual-monitor setup. 
  <p> <b>Display settings and color depth</b><br>
    Changes to screen resolution and color depth can be done here. The resulting 
    frame rate will be higher, when using a lower resolution, but when watching 
    the frames carefully, you might see the pixels due to their relatively large 
    size. In higher resolution the pixels are smaller and the frames look better. 
    The frames also look better when using 32 bit colors. In 16 bit color mode 
    you might see edges between the different colors especially in places with 
    color gradients. The available resolutions and color depths are dependent 
    on what the graphics card driver offers. The default resolution is 1024x768 
    with 32 bit colors. 
  <p> <b>Anti-Aliasing</b><br>
    Use the Antialiasing drop-down control to enable Full-Scene Anti-Aliasing 
    (FSAA) and to select the FSAA quality setting. The benchmark result will be 
    far lower, when using FSAA, especially when using higher quality FSAA. However, 
    the graphics on the screen will look better when FSAA is used. Due to the 
    high impact of FSAA on the performance, FSAA is disabled by default. Also, 
    different cards might produce FSAA of different quality, and this is something 
    we don't have a reliable way to measure. 
  <p> <b>NOTE!</b> It is up to your graphics card drivers, which FSAA options 
    can be selected here. Some drivers don't allow FSAA setting changes through 
    the standard DX8 interface. In such cases you must change the FSAA settings 
    from the display settings in the Windows Control Panel. Additionally, different 
    cards might produce FSAA of different quality. You can compare the FSAA quality 
    with the Image Quality tests in Resultbrowser2001 SE that is included in 3DMark2001 
    SE Pro. 
  <p> <b>Frame Buffer</b><br>
    The Frame Buffer selector chooses how many frame buffers are used. A double 
    frame buffer means that there is one back buffer for the 3D accelerator to 
    draw to, while the previous frame is being displayed. A triple buffer shows 
    one frame, while there are two back buffers to draw to. The 3DMark2001 SE 
    benchmark runs with vertical synchronization (vsync) turned off, which means 
    that there should not be much difference in the result whether you use a double 
    or triple frame buffer. The default is double buffer, due to the lower graphics 
    card memory consumption. Many games use a triple buffer, because vsync is 
    on by default and there might be time to draw more than one frame while the 
    previous frame is being displayed. This can make the frame rate steadier, 
    resulting in smoother looking action. 
  <p> <b>Texture Format </b><br>
    You can choose between 16 or 32 color bit textures and, if your card supports 
    it, you can also use compressed textures. The advantage of texture compression 
    in 3DMark2001 SE is that the compressed textures are four times larger than 
    the uncompressed textures. This higher texture resolution makes the textured 
    3D objects look much more detailed and realistic. The reason for a lower texture 
    resolution in uncompressed textures is that uncompressed textures in higher 
    resolution would make the overall requirements for texture memory higher than 
    what is currently available in many of the graphics cards in use today. This 
    would mean that textures would be transferred between the graphics card and 
    the system memory or possibly the hard drive in the middle of the benchmark 
    run. This kind of texture swapping would seriously decrease the frame rate 
    of the benchmark tests. 
  <p> 3DMark2001 SE uses standard DirectX Texture Compression (DXTC), which is 
    also known as S3TC. Only formats 1 and 3 of DXTC are used, but both of these 
    must be supported in order for 3DMark2001 SE to take advantage of DXTC. If 
    the graphics card supports DXTC, it will be selected by default; otherwise 
    32 bit textures will be selected.
  <p><b>NOTE: </b>3DMark2001 SE has a new option: DXTC1 only. This setting is 
    by default selected for graphics cards supporting DXTC1 but not DXTC3. With 
    this setting DXTC1 is used for non-transparent textures, and 32 bit uncompressed 
    and downscaled transparent textures.
  <p> <b>Z-Buffer Depth</b><br>
    Most graphics card drivers allow you to select between 16, 24 and 32 bit Z-buffer. 
    Some offer all of these and others only 16 and 24. A smaller Z-buffer might 
    show some Z-artifacts (some flickering thin or smaller objects further from 
    the camera in the 3D scene). This flickering is due to the inaccurate Z-buffer 
    - the card cannot decide which object is closest to the camera and should 
    be displayed in front of the others. 
  <p> <b>Rendering Pipeline</b><br>
    There are some options on how to render the frames. Older systems do the transformation 
    and lighting (T&L) of the geometry using the system CPU. This is what is done 
    when using the D3D Software T&L pipeline. Modern graphics cards can do T&L 
    in the graphics processor, and this is called Hardware T&L (HWTL). 
  <p> DX8 introduced a new rendering pipeline, the Pure Hardware T&amp;L (PureHAL, 
    Pure Hardware Abstraction Layer). This pipeline places higher demands on the 
    graphics card, but is faster than the Hardware T&L (HAL) pipeline. 
  <p> The best rendering pipeline supported by your system is used by default. 
    The ranking order is the following: 
  <ol>
    <li>D3D Pure Hardware T&amp;L
    <li>D3D Hardware T&L 
    <li>D3D Software T&L 
  </ol>
  <p> <b>NOTE!</b> Only those rendering pipelines supported by your system will 
    be displayed. If your system should for example be able to use Hardware T&amp;L, 
    but the drop down selector does not offer this option, there is something 
    wrong with your system setup, most likely with your graphics card drivers.

    <br>
  <h3>Display Settings and Performance</h3>
  <p>All display settings follow the same rule, when inspecting how these settings 
    affect the system performance. All higher values produce an animation (real 
    time) of better quality in one way or another. The downside is that settings 
    of higher values will cause a higher consumption of graphics card memory and/or 
    more data needs to be transferred between the memory and processor of the 
    graphics card. Some settings cause simply more work for the graphics processor 
    or the CPU. All higher values more or less impact the performance negatively.</p>
  <a name="defaultsettings"></a><br>
  <br>
  <h3>Default Settings</h3>
  <p>The default settings of 3DMark2001 SE are as follows:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>1024 x 768 resolution 
    <li>32 bit colors 
    <li>Compressed textures (or 32-bit textures if DXTC is not available)
    <li>32 or 24 bit Z-buffer 
    <li>Double frame buffer 
    <li>VSYNC off (if the display driver allows) 
    <li>FSAA off (if the display driver allows) 
    <li>The best rendering pipeline supported by your system 
    <li>All of the tests selected 
    <li>Demo sound effects and music on and looping turned off 
    <li>Low detail graphics in the game demo and both music and sounds effects 
      on 
  </ul>

  <br>
  <h3>Benchmark results</h3>
  <p> <img src="../images/s-orb-button.jpg" width="344" height="230"> 
  <p> 
  <p>When the benchmark run is complete, the Overall Score dialog shows your score. 
    Below the 3DMark score is the button for accessing the <a class="normal" href="http://gamershq.madonion.com/products/orb/" target="_blank">Online 
    ResultBrowser</a> (ORB). 3DMark2001 SE gives separate scores for each of the 
    tests, but calculates the 3DMark score from the measured average frame rates 
    of the game tests. </p>
  <p><b>The 3DMark score is calculated using the following formula:</b></p>
  <p>3DMark score = (Game1LowDetail + Game2LowDetail + Game3LowDetail) * 10 + 
    (Game1HighDetail + Game2HighDetail + Game3HighDetail + Game4) * 20</p>
  <p>Game1LowDetail means the average frame rate of the first game test in low 
    detail etc.</p>
  <p>You can view the frame rates of the separate game tests and the results of 
    the theoretical tests with the Online ResultBrowser. You can also view the 
    result details by clicking the Show Details button, but the ORB contains many 
    other services with valuable information about your system, which cannot be 
    obtained off-line.</p>
  <p>The specific tests and their result units are listed below:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Game tests - fps (frames / second) 
    <li>Fill rate - MegaTexels (million texels / second) 
    <li>High polygon count - MegaPolygons (million polygons / second) 
    <li>Bump mapping - fps 
    <li>Vertex shader - fps 
    <li>Pixel shader - fps 
    <li>Advanced Pixel shader - fps 
    <li>Point sprites - MegaSprites (million point sprites / second)
    <li>Image quality - this test produces sample images to be viewed with <a class="normal" href="profeatures.htm#resultbrowser">ResultBrowser2001

  <h3>CPU Test</h3>
  <p>This is a separate test, which gives the frame rate of the test directly 
    after the test run. Click the CPU test button in the main window to run the 
    CPU test. The details of the CPU test can be found <a class="normal" href="tests.htm#cputests">here</a>. 
    The CPU test always uses 640 x 480 resolution and the best available custom 
    CPU rendering pipeline. If your CPU supports none of the available custom 
    pipelines, the D3D software T&L pipeline is used in the test. The CPU test 
    result is the average frame rate of the test run and the unit of measurement 
    is fps.</p>
  <p>Newer CPUs have special instructions for speeding up the T&L. The so called 
    custom pipelines use these CPU instructions for speeding up the T&L. The custom 
    pipelines available in 3DMark2001 as follows (in alphabetical order):<br>

  </p>
  <h3>Command Line Switches</h3>
  <p>All available command line options are presented in a window, when you start 
    3DMark2001 SE with the switch /help. This can be done in at least two ways:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Drag the 3DMark2001SE.exe file or the 3DMark2001 SE desktop shortcut to 
      the Run dialog of your Start menu. Press the Start button on your desktop 
      and then select Run to open the Run dialog. When the 3DMark2001 SE file 
      or shortcut is in the text field of the Run dialog, move the cursor to the 
      end of the text, add a space, type /help and click OK. 
    <li>Edit the 3DMark2001 SE shortcut on your desktop by clicking it with the 
      right mouse button. Select properties and edit the Target: text field. Move 
      the cursor to the end of the text, add a space, type /help and click OK. 
      Next time you click the 3DMark2001 SE desktop shortcut the command line 
      switches will be displayed. Remember to change the shortcut back to the 
      way it was, so that you can run 3DMark2001 SE again. 
  </ol>
  <p>Use the command line switches the same way you used the /help switch. The 
    command line switches are the following:</p>
  /help - show all command line switches<br>
  /benchmark - run the benchmark<br>
  /demo - run the demo<br>
  /game - run the game demo<br>
  <p>All of these command line switches executes the specified parts of 3DMark2001 
    SE immediately, without going through the main window.</p>
  <p>You can also put the name of a 3DMark2001 SE project file after the switch. 
    This will access the project or batch run file and initiate the settings you 
    previously specified. Example: 3DMark2001SE.exe /benchmark mysettings.3dp</p>
  <p>One good use of command line switches allows you to start the 3DMark2001 
    SE demo automatically after Windows has booted up. Make a 3DMark2001 SE shortcut 
    with the /demo switch and the name of a file where the demo has been set to 
    loop. Right click on the Start Button; Open the Programs File; Click on the 
    Start-Up Folder and copy your new 3DMark2001 SE shortcut to this folder. Then 
    every time the PC is booted-up, the 3DMark2001 SE demo starts looping automatically.</p>

  <h3>Other functionality</h3>
  <p><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2" color="#e0dcd3">You can save your 
    customized 3DMark2001 SE settings, so that you can retrieve those settings 
    simply by reloading a file. Save your 3DMark settings by clicking the File 
    menu of the main window and select the Save As... menu item. A dialog will 
    open, allowing you to choose where you'd like to save your settings. If you 
    change your settings and want to overwrite the settings you have just saved, 
    just click the Save menu item of the same File menu.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2" color="#e0dcd3">The 3DMark settings you can customize include:</font></p>
  <font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2" color="#e0dcd3">
  <ul>
    <li>Project name and comments 
    <li>Selected tests 
    <li>Benchmark and demo options, like looping and enabling sounds 
    <li>Display and CPU settings 
    <li>Batch run settings 
  </ul>
  </font>
  <p><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2" color="#e0dcd3">You can take screenshots 
    by pressing the F12 key during any of the tests and the demos. The screenshot 
    will be saved in the 3DMark2001 SE installation folder in .BMP format.</font></p>
  <p><font face="Arial, sans-serif" size="2" color="#e0dcd3"><b>NOTE:</b> Taking 
    a screenshot affects your test result by a temporary performance drop. Therefore 
    the result of the current test will be discarded, when you take a screenshot.<br>

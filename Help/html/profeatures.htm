<h3>Pro vs. free version</h3>

  <p>3DMark®2001 SE ships in two versions: downloadable free version and the commercial 
    Pro version. As the name indicates, the free version is downloadable from 
    <a class="normal" href="http://www.madonion.com/download/" target="_blank">www.madonion.com/download/</a>, 
    and the Pro version can be obtained by <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="http://www.madonion.com/purchase">registering 
    and paying for the Pro license.</a></p>
  <p>Please, read the <a class="normal" href="about.htm#license">license agreement</a> 
    for details about the distribution and usage rights of both of these versions 
    of 3DMark2001 SE.</p>
  <p>As with the previous versions of 3DMark, the Pro version offers additional 
    features. The added features are the following:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>ResultBrowser2001 SE - A result analyzing and comparing power tool for 
      pro users. 
    <li>Batch Run - Pre-select a number of tests to be run in various resolutions 
      and settings. Let your PC work while you grab a coffee, or go home for the 
      weekend, depending on the length of your selected batch run. Pro users have 
      been very grateful for this feature in the past versions of 3DMark. 
    <li>Image quality test - One sample screenshot is taken from each high detail 
      game test. The sample images can be taken either with or without full-scene 
      anti-aliasing (FSAA). Use the ResultBrowser2001 SE for inspecting these 
      in detail and comparing them to the reference images rendered using the 
      D3D reference rasterizer. There is a set of reference images without FSAA 
      and an additional set using 9 sample FSAA. 
    <li>Game demo - What's that they say about "All Work and No Play"? Nothing 
      "Dull" here! <br>
      It's the first game test with the car shooting down hostile, flying robots, 
      only this time you're behind the wheel and you're equipped with a missile 
      launcher! Read more about it <a class="normal" href="quickstart.htm#play">here</a>. 
  </ul>

  <h3>ResultBrowser2001 SE</h3>

  <p> <img src="../images/s-result-browser-window.jpg" width="389" height="386">
  <p>

  <p>ResultBrowser2001 SE is the most efficient tool for analyzing, managing and 
    comparing your 3DMark2001 SE results. You can gather large numbers of results 
    in one database to compare them with each other in every respect. ResultBrowser2001 
    SE is also the tool for measuring the quality of the image quality test images. 
    It allows you to zoom and compare to reference images, do pixel-to-pixel comparisons, 
    as well as performing any of these functions simultaneously.</p>

    File.</p>

<h3>Batch Run</h3>

  <p>It's as easy as this: Select which of the tests you want to run, select the 
    resolutions and customize the other settings you want to run the tests in, 
    select where you want the results to be stored and the go to lunch while your 
    PC goes through all the desired tests!</p>
  <p>Batch Run has an easy to use wizard for choosing the batch run settings. 
    For example, you can let your PC run through all tests on all resolutions 
    and with all rendering pipelines. It can all be done in one single batch run.</p>

  <p>Our Batch Run Wizard works like this: </p>
  <ol>
    <li>Select the display settings and setting combinations for the batch run. 
    <li>Select the tests to be run. Note that there is a time estimate for the 
      run, which changes for each selection you make. 
    <li>Choose where you want to save the results. You can also specify the naming 
      convention for your saved result files. 
    <li>This is the last dialog before the batch run starts. Check that your settings 
      are correct and start the batch run. You can also save the settings for 
      this batch run for later use (like, if you intend to use the command line 
      start up for the batch run).
  </ol>
<a name="combinedusage"></a><br><br>
  <h3>Combined Usage</h3>

  <p>The batch run is especially powerful when you combine it with the command 
    line functionality. Make a batch run that starts automatically on system boot 
    up, using the command line functionality, and select a network drive to save 
    the results to. This is the way PC assembly companies can use 3DMark2001 SE 
    Pro for automatic functionality and 3D performance testing. Just wipe the 
    hard drive of the PC to be tested with an image of the operating system and 
    3DMark2001 SE with the settings described above, and turn on the power. The 
    PC will automatically boot, start 3DMark2001 SE, run the batch run, and store 
    the results on the selected network drive. Your freshly assembled PC will 
    then be efficiently tested.</p>
  <p><b>NOTE!</b> If you use this testing methodology for assembly line testing, 
    remember to uninstall 3DMark2001 SE Pro and delete all related system registry 
    entries, or simply clear the hard drive of the PC. This is necessary, because 
    the registry will contain 3DMark2001 SE Pro license information after the 
    PC has been tested.</p>

  <h3>Running the default benchmark</h3>

  <p><img src="../images/s-benchmark-button.jpg" width="390" height="363"> 
  <p>

  <p>Click the Benchmark button in the main window of 3DMark2001 SE to run the 
    benchmark. Right after start up, the benchmark always has the default display 
    settings and all tests are selected.</p>

  <p><img src="../images/s-orb-button.jpg" width="344" height="230"> 
  <p>

  <p>After the benchmark run, you get the 3DMark score (if you have run all game 
    tests) and right below that number, there is a button that will take you to 
    our Online ResultBrowser (ORB), where you can compare your PC's performance 
    with other systems from around the world. In the ORB, you will also get estimates 
    of how well your PC would perform if you would change the 3D accelerator or 
    the CPU in your system.</p>
  <p><b>NOTE: </b>Before you access our Online ResultBrowser and submit your benchmark 
    results, please read through our Legal Agreement and verify that you agree 
    with the terms as they are laid out.</p>

  <h3>Running the demo</h3>

  <p><img src="../images/s-demo-button.jpg" width="390" height="363"> 
  <p>

  <p>Click the Demo button in the main window of 3DMark2001 SE to run the demo. 
    You will then be asked if you want to use the selected resolution, or if you 
    want to use a lower resolution for better frame rates during the demo. If 
    you have a system comparable to the <a class="normal" href="index.htm#system">minimum 
    system requirements</a>, you should run the demo in the suggested lower resolution 
    for a better experience.</p>

  <a name="play"></a><br><br>
  <h3>The Interactive Game Demo</h3>

  <p>The game demo is only available in the Pro version of 3DMark2001 SE. You 
    can <a class="normal" target="_blank" href="http://www.madonion.com/purchase">purchase</a> 
    the Pro version on the MadOnion.com website for full functionality.</p>
  <p> <img src="../images/s-game-button.jpg" width="390" height="363"> 

  <p>Start the game demo by clicking the Game Demo button in the main window of 
    3DMark2001 SE. You will then be asked if you want to use the selected resolution, 
    or if you want to use a lower resolution for better frame rates during the 
    game demo. If you have a system comparable to the <a class="normal" href="index.htm#system">minimum 
    system requirements</a>, you should run the game demo in the suggested lower 
    resolution for a better experience.</p>
  <p>After the loading screen you will see the first game test with the car and 
    flying hunter robots, but this time you are in control of the car. Steer the 
    car and shoot down flying robots using the following keys on your keyboard: 
  </p>

  <ul>
<li>W - accelerate
<li>S - brake and reverse
<li>A - steer left
<li>D - steer right
    <li>T - target robot and fire missile 
    <li>Space - handbrake
    <li>1-8 - different driving cameras 
    <li><backspace> Backspace - restart the game demo 
    <li>Esc - exit the game demo 
  </ul>

  <p>You can also steer the car using the arrow keys. The missile launcher works 
    as follows. Keep the 'T' key pressed while the missile system tries to get 
    a lock on a flying robot. When a missile is locked, release the button and 
    a homing missile will be launched. It might miss the robot in the first fly 
    by, but it will turn back towards the robot it locked on to. Hitting a building 
    or some other object will keep the missile from destroying the robot.</p>
  <p>This is just a game demo, not a complete game with storyline, multiple levels 
    or a particular goal to achieve. Avoid the crossfire and pot-holes, shoot 
    down all the flying hunter robots and restart for more hunting, or simply 
    keep driving around, enjoy the post-apocalyptic scenery and perform some cool 
    stunts. </p>
  <p>Happy hunting!</p>

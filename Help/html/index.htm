  <h3>Welcome to 3DMark®2001 Second Edition (SE)</h3>
  <p>MadOnion.com is proud to present 3DMark2001 SE, the global standard for 3D 
    game performance measurement. Like all of our benchmarks in the 3DMark Series, 
    3DMark2001 SE is an accurate and reliable diagnostics tool, which continues 
    to provide you with benchmark results that empower you to make informed hardware 
    assessments. It also combines DirectX®8.1 support with stunning scenes in 
    real time 3D graphics, giving you a hint of what the graphics quality in games 
    could be in the future.</p>
  While running the awesome scenes, 3DMark measures the game performance of your 
  PC and provides you with: 
  <ul>
    <li>The 3DMark score, which is a standard, globally recognized, comparable 
      measurement of PC game performance. 
    <li>Detailed results of all of the tests, including tests measuring theoretical 
      speed, and some trying out <a class="normal" href="tests.htm#dx8tests">new 
      DirectX8 (DX8) hardware accelerated features</a>. 
    <li>Comparison of your system's 3D gaming performance to the results of other 
      3DMark2001 SE users from around the world. See how your PC performs against 
      the fastest PCs there is. 
    <li>A reliable estimate of how your system would perform, if you were to upgrade 
      your graphics card or CPU. 
  </ul>

  <h3>Build 330 New Features</h3>
  <p> 3DMark2001 Second Edition (build 300) was our major update for 3DMark2001, 
    and as such, even contained a new test. The Advanced Pixel Shader test demonstrates 
    the latest in Pixel Shader technology, but also offers some nice eye candy. 
    Four months after the 3DMark2001 SE launch DX9 betas got out and revealed 
    a DX version identification problem. Also, new hardware has been released 
    or will be released in the near future, requiring further updating. All of 
    this made it sensible to update 3DMark2001, to build 330, in order to offer 
    the latest technology for 3D game performance benchmarking.</p>
  <font size="2" ,="," face="Arial, sans-serif" color="E0DCD3">The build 330 new 
  features are</font>: 
  <ul>
    <li><font size="2" ,="," face="Arial, sans-serif" color="E0DCD3">Future DirectX

  <h3>Introduction to 3DMark®2001 SE</h3>
  <p> 3DMark2001 SE is a diagnostics tool for measuring the 3D game performance 
    of PCs. It is entertaining and easy to use, which makes it "must have" software 
    for all PC users interested in 3D games. Even a beginner PC user can get a 
    game performance measurement with 3DMark2001 SE. For the more advanced users, 
    3DMark2001 SE offers a wide range of display settings and testing options 
    for the benchmark run. The most skillful performance tweakers can get the 
    latest news on PC performance upgrading through MadOnion.com's on-line services. 
    There you can also challenge the fastest PCs in the world and get good performance 
    tuning advice in the discussion forum or the on-line chat.</p>
  <p>At the same time, 3DMark2001 SE is a reliable tool for professional hardware 
    performance measurement and comparison. The Pro version of 3DMark2001 SE includes 
    additional tools for pro-users, making their work easier, less time consuming 
    and more fun. The Pro version of 3DMark2001 SE can be purchased on-line, allowing 
    you access to all of the "Pro features".</p>
  <p>3DMark2001 SE uses a real game engine (MAX-FX Technology™, by Remedy Entertainment) 
    in all tests. This means that the obtained performance level in the game tests 
    is accurate. If additional time would be spent on implementing more content, 
    interactivity and game storylines, all game tests could be made into real 
    games. We have proven this by making a game demo of the first game test. The 
    scene is the same as in the test, but this time you are behind the steering 
    wheel.</p>

  <br>
  <h3>System Requirements</h3>
  <p>3DMark2001 SE is the tool for measuring 3D game performance of the latest 
    PC hardware. This means that some older hardware does not have what it takes 
    to run some of 3DMark2001 SE. If your system cannot run 3DMark2001 SE, we 
    encourage you to download (from <a class="normal" href="http://www.madonion.com/download/" target="_blank">www.MadOnion.com/download</a>) 
    and run 3DMark2000.</p>
  Minimum System Requirements: 
  <ul>
    <li>Intel® compatible 500 MHz processor 
    <li>128 MB system memory 
    <li>1999 released 3D accelerator with 32 MB memory 
    <li>Windows 98/SE, ME, 2000 or XP operating system 
    <li>DirectX 8.1 or later 
  </ul>
  <p><b>NOTE:</b> If you run Windows 2000 or Windows XP Professional, 192 MB of 
    system memory is recommended.</p>
  <p>3DMark2001 SE does run on systems that don't quite meet the minimum requirements, 
    but for example less video memory will cause texture swapping in the middle 
    of some tests. Texture swapping would seriously distort the test result, which 
    means that the result could not be concidered a reliable measurement of the 
    system's game performance. </p>
  Recommended System Specifications: 
  <ul>
    <li>Intel® compatible 1 GHz processor 
    <li>Fully DirectX 8 compatible graphics hardware 
  </ul>
